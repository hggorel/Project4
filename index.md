# Climate Change Impacting Country's Decisions?
### By: Hannah Gorel

## Introduction

- What is the core discovery you made, the most interesting thing that you can describe with this data? 
- What will your supporting arguments be for your discovery?

## Dataset

I pulled multiple datasets and effectively combined them into one larger dataset since they were all related.  The data is comparing individual country's percentage of protected lands, climate change risk, emissions statistics, and how these things all interact with each other and possible repurcussions of certain things.

I used datasets specifically from the OECD and UN Environmental Program datasets like ProtectedPlanet and others.  The data is about either the environmental 
- What is this data about?
- Who collected or produced this dataset? Why?
- Why are you interested in it?

## Initial Questions

Upon first choices of different types of data, I was drawn to the UN Environmental Program information quickly because of the real impact that climate change
and the environmental choices country's are making has on our lives and future generations.  Of course some things happening with climate change aren't one specific country's fault, but if the UN gets involved in encouraging better environmental decisions then hopefully the decline could be slowed.  So I decided to look into whether or not statistics are supporting country's realizing their impact and actively attempting to counteract their negative actions.  Some of the initial questions that I thought of along these lines were these:

1. How do the emissions of certain countries correlate to their amount of protected lands? 
2. How does the climate risk of a country impact their emissions? (If at high risk are they being preventative early?)
3. How does climate risk correlate to the economic growth/decline of a country?

These questions would help to see if there is a correlation between any of these factors.  If country's with high emissions also are protecting large percentages
or lands then they're actively trying to counteract their negative impact (more risk leading to more protections).  However, if country's with high emissions have the lowest amount of protections then it would imply less concern with the environment's health.  Additionally, "climate risk" being how much a country stands to lose if climate change worsens, are country's being preventative early if they stand to lose more than others?
  
- What questions came up as you worked with the data? 
- Was there anything that surprised you about the data?
- Was it easy to work with or did you have to clean or "wrangle" the data?

### Emissions Over Time

Over this 18 year time period we can see the emergence of China as the highest emission producing country while the United States fell out of first place, which is good.  It is important to note that the exact scale changes with each year.  The highest emissions recorded in 2000 were much lower than the highest emissions recorded in 2018, but the switch of countries producing the most is still relevant and could indicate a slight greater effort for preserving the environment and decreasing the negative environmental impact on the part of that country.  This is where I started looking into the different other factors and ratings that my data sets contained including Climate Risk Index (CRI), Endangered Species stats and Amounts of Protected Lands for each country.

### A Closer Look at Highest Impacting Countries

As we saw in the emissions graph, a few specific countries had the most emissions recorded in 2018.  Brazil, China, the EU, India, Japan, Russia and the United States all had the highest emissions on record.
