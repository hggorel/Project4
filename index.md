# Is Climate Change Influencing/Impacting Country's Decisions?
### By: Hannah Gorel

## Introduction

While it is generally accepted that climate change is occurring in the world, it doesn't appear that the largest countries are making any great strides in terms of reducing their impact.  Over the past 20 years, numbers of emissions are only rising and are resulting in higher number of endangered species in those countries without any preventative increases of protected lands or other proactive actions.  It's important to note that there isn't a direct correlation between all of these factors, though endangered species numbers are getting larger they're location isn't totally related to countries with the most emissions.  There is a larger correlation than I hoped for between countries with high emissions and low environmental protections though.  Countries should be using environmental data like this to influence their policy decisions and halt their negative environmental impact, but it doesn't appear to be changing anything yet.

## Dataset

I pulled multiple datasets on related environmental topics and utilized Tableau to compare different features of each set since they all shared some of the same locations.  The data compares different individual country's percentage of protected lands, climate risks, emissions statistics, and scores for amounts of endangered species.  I was then able to create graphs to examine and present how these things all interact with each other and correlate.

I used datasets specifically from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and from UN Environmental Program datasets like ProtectedPlanet.  The OECD collects data on biodiversity and different environmental factors to help countries create and implement effective policies relating to these problems.  The UN Environmental Program additionally collects data on climate, nature, pollution, emissions, risks to help their members make decisions based on the most accurate data possible.  Though I'm not personally making decisions on any of these things as I'm not a politician, I do think that the environment is extremely important and changes have to be happening on the nation-level to actually make an impact on the world.  Individual people can do what they can, but until countries actively make a decision to improve their global impact, it will be very difficult if not impossible to stop the negative trends.

## Initial Questions

Upon first choices of different types of data, I was drawn to the UN Environmental Program information quickly because of the real impact that climate change
and the environmental choices country's are making has on our lives and future generations.  Of course some things happening with climate change aren't one specific country's fault, but if the UN gets involved in encouraging better environmental decisions then hopefully the decline could be slowed.  So I decided to look into whether or not statistics are supporting country's realizing their impact and actively attempting to counteract their negative actions.  Some of the initial questions that I thought of along these lines were these:

1. How do the emissions of certain countries correlate to their amount of protected lands? 
2. How does the climate risk of a country impact their emissions? (If at high risk are they being preventative early?)
3. How does climate risk correlate to the economic growth/decline of a country?

These questions would help to see if there is a correlation between any of these factors.  If country's with high emissions also are protecting large percentages
or lands then they're actively trying to counteract their negative impact (more risk leading to more protections).  However, if country's with high emissions have the lowest amount of protections then it would imply less concern with the environment's health.  Additionally, "climate risk" being how much a country stands to lose if climate change worsens, are country's being preventative early if they stand to lose more than others?

As I started to work with the data I was able to conclude that in the past few years the countries with the highest emissions reported in 2018 did not make any significant increases to their amounts of "protected" lands.  In fact, the country with the highest emissions has the second to least percentage of protected lands.  In my investigation of the second two questions I was led to look into the relationships between the amount of endangered species in particular countries along with their recorded emissions and CRI rank.  The Climate Risk Index (CRI) rank evaluates the amount of impact that the environmental anomalies or extremities had on individual countries.  So I began looking into whether having a high CRI rank would impact the country's decisions or emissions.  In that exploration, after having a general world-view on most of the comparisons I looked specifically into the few countries who reported the highest emissions in 2018 (the latest dates that the catalogue had).

The data was relatively easy to work with, the main problem being that different data sets had slightly different countries included in their collections.  So I had to be careful to directly compare and look specifically into countries that were included on multiple data sets to have the most amount of comparisons available to me.

(Fig 3) The emissions recorded in 2018 for over 100 countries presented as a bubble graph    

Over this 18 year time period we can see the emergence of China as the highest emission producing country while the United States fell out of first place, which is good.  It is important to note that the exact scale changes with each year.  The highest emissions recorded in 2000 were much lower than the highest emissions recorded in 2018, but the switch of countries producing the most is still relevant and could indicate a slight greater effort for preserving the environment and decreasing the negative environmental impact on the part of that country.  This is where I started looking into the different other factors and ratings that my data sets contained including Climate Risk Index (CRI), Endangered Species stats and Amounts of Protected Lands for each country.

### World View
<img src="https://hggorel.github.io/Project4/assets/images/Graph1Final.PNG" width="750" height="550">
(Fig 4 - Country's standings in terms of Climate Risk Index (CRI) ranks displayed as a geogrpahical map as of 2018.  The lighter colors indicate a higher risk rank, meaning that those countries were impact much higher by various climate change impacts such as weather and temperature anomalies)

After looking at the CRI ranks themselves, I was curious about whether or not countries with high (as in 1st, 2nd, ...) ranks would have low emissions in these years because of the weather events to lessen their impact.

(Fig 5 - This map graph compares the individual countries CRI rank with their emissions, both statistics from 2018. The size of the circle on each country represents their recorded emissions while the color of the circle (shades of blue) represents the rank with lighter colors indicating higher rank)

We can see here that the lighter blue circles are typically quite large, while most of the darker circles are small.  This shows that the highly ranked countries still had very high emissions recorded whether that was intentional or just circumstantial.  However, some of the large ones are a more medium-toned blue like China for example, so it's risk rank wasn't too high.

I then shifted focuses and decided to look at the protected lands that each country has set aside to preserve biodiversity and natural resources.

(Fig 6 - Bar graph depicting the amounts of protected lands as of 2018 in different countries, scores in relative terms of the total protected lands versus the amount of total land of the country)

The organization that collected this data used a relative scoring evaluation instead of just the direct amount of land protected to make sure that it wouldn't be skewed by just the sheer size of each individual country.  So percentages of the total land of the country were used to assign a score.  However, we can see that the countries with the highest amounts of protected lands are not necessarily familiar names from earlier in the research, they aren't the largest or most impacting countries.

(Fig 7 - This scatter plot compares the different scores assigned by the OECD of each country in terms of amounts of endangered species in the year 2020.  The color compares the endangered species to amounts of protected lands as the light blue represents higher protected areas, while dark represents less protected lands, to look for a possible correlation there)

The last piece of new data that I looked at was the different amounts of endangered species reported in each country.  We can see that the USA has many endangered animals while other countries like Poland or Estonia have much lower numbers.  Additionally I compared the amount of protected lands with the amounts of endangered species using the color of the boxes to see if there's a general trend in relationship.  The lighter color boxes are for less protected lands while the darker blue represents more.  So we can see that it isn't directly related there, with both DEU and SVN having high species and land counts, while the USA and most of the countries in the middle of the graph don't have as much protected lands.

### A Closer Look at Highest Emission Countries

After looking at a lot of the statistics from a more global view looking for specific trends in all of them, I decided to more closely examine a few specific countries.  As we saw in the emissions graph, Brazil, China, the EU, India, Japan, Russia and the United States all had the highest emissions on record in 2018.  In further exploration of these countries in particular I was hoping to see a trend in these countries decisions or impacts that could make them have the highest emissions.

(Fig 8 - This multi-bar chart breaks and compares the biggest contribution areas to each countries emissions in the 2018 reporting, the main categories being Energy, Electricity/Power and Industrial Processes) 

We can see that of these three main areas, Energy is the largest percentage of all of their emissions by far.  Even the countries with significantly less emissions follow in that trend of having Energy as the highest contributor.  This could help countries in their policy making to see where the highest amount of their impact is coming from.

(Fig 9 - This multi-bar chart breaks down the factors that went into the CRI rating specifically for each of the high emission countries to see if the emissions relate to any of those factors)

I then specifically looked into the CRI rank of the high impact countries.  There wasn't a direct correlation here at all, some had a very high rank while some had a very low rank.  It also was able to be split into two of the factors that determine the rank, one being the Fatalities per 100,000 of population and second being Losses per GDP %.  So this brings in population and economic statistics as well as our existing environmental focus.  This shows that there isn't a strong correlation between emissions and the risk that a country has should climate change worsen.  So these countries aren't necessarily looking to the future to prevent further damage to themselves by lowering their emission levels, at least in the time frame examined here.

<img src="https://hggorel.github.io/Project4/assets/images/Graph5Final.PNG" width="650" height="450">
(Fig 10 - This line graph explores the years 2017-2021 comparing the specified countries who reported the largest emissions in 2018 to see if any preventative actions would be taken given their high negative environmental impact)

I then looked into the amount of protected areas over time of these countries to hopefully see an increase following their 2018 year of very high emissions.  However, this did not end up panning out, we can see that China which had the highest emissions has barely any protected lands.  The lines are practically flat showing that the countries did not take any preventative steps to counteract their extremely high emissions from the previous years.

## Conclusion

I found a few interesting conclusions from my explorations.  Contrary to my initial hope and belief, most of the countries reported with the highest emissions do not have high percentages of protected environmental areas.  They are not currently taking those preventative steps to counteract their impact, however there wasn't a direct correlation between high emissions and high endangered species counts.  So there are other factors than emissions which are contributing to the endangered species in countries that lied outside the scope of this project.  Additionally, the CRI rank of countries did not correlate to a lower emission report as I had originally guessed it might.  This shows that not all of the countries who have been heavily impacted by climate anomalies are making a large successful effort to decrease their environmental impact, though they would likely be at risk further if climate change worsens.  Therefore, we can conclude that the countries with the highest emissions should make more of an effort to have a positive environmental impact, but also acknowledge that there are other factors and considerations for some biodiversity and environmental changes.
