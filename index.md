# Is Climate Change Influencing/Impacting Country's Decisions?
### By: Hannah Gorel

## Introduction

While it is generally accepted that climate change is occurring in the world, it doesn't appear that the largest countries are making any great strides in terms of reducing their impact.  Over the past 20 years, numbers of emissions are only rising and are resulting in higher number of endangered species in those countries without any preventative increases of protected lands or other proactive actions.  

- What is the core discovery you made, the most interesting thing that you can describe with this data? 
- What will your supporting arguments be for your discovery?

## Dataset

I pulled multiple datasets on related environmental topics and utilized Tableau to compare different features of each set since they all shared some of the same locations.  The data compares different individual country's percentage of protected lands, climate risks, emissions statistics, and scores for amounts of endangered species.  I was then able to create graphs to examine and present how these things all interact with each other and correlate.

I used datasets specifically from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and from UN Environmental Program datasets like ProtectedPlanet.  The OECD collects data on biodiversity and different environmental factors to help countries create and implement effective policies relating to these problems.  The UN Environmental Program additionally collects data on climate, nature, pollution, emissions, risks to help their members make decisions based on the most accurate data possible.  Though I'm not personally making decisions on any of these things as I'm not a politician, I do think that the environment is extremely important and changes have to be happening on the nation-level to actually make an impact on the world.  INdividual people can do what they can, but until countries actively make a decision to improve their global impact, it will be very difficult if not impossible to stop the negative trends.

## Initial Questions

Upon first choices of different types of data, I was drawn to the UN Environmental Program information quickly because of the real impact that climate change
and the environmental choices country's are making has on our lives and future generations.  Of course some things happening with climate change aren't one specific country's fault, but if the UN gets involved in encouraging better environmental decisions then hopefully the decline could be slowed.  So I decided to look into whether or not statistics are supporting country's realizing their impact and actively attempting to counteract their negative actions.  Some of the initial questions that I thought of along these lines were these:

1. How do the emissions of certain countries correlate to their amount of protected lands? 
2. How does the climate risk of a country impact their emissions? (If at high risk are they being preventative early?)
3. How does climate risk correlate to the economic growth/decline of a country?

These questions would help to see if there is a correlation between any of these factors.  If country's with high emissions also are protecting large percentages
or lands then they're actively trying to counteract their negative impact (more risk leading to more protections).  However, if country's with high emissions have the lowest amount of protections then it would imply less concern with the environment's health.  Additionally, "climate risk" being how much a country stands to lose if climate change worsens, are country's being preventative early if they stand to lose more than others?

As I started to work with the data I was able to conclude that in the past few years the countries with the highest emissions reported in 2018 did not make any significant increases to their amounts of "protected" lands.  In fact, the country with the highest emissions has the second to least percentage of protected lands.  In my investigation of the second two questions I was led to look into the relationships between the amount of endangered species in particular countries along with their recorded emissions and CRI rank.  The Climate Risk Index (CRI) rank evaluates the amount of impact that the environmental anomalies or extremities had on individual countries.  So I began looking into whether having a high CRI rank would impact the country's decisions or emissions.  In that exploration, after having a general world-view on most of the comparisons I looked specifically into the few countries who reported the highest emissions in 2018 (the latest dates that the catalogue had).

The data was relatively easy to work with, the main problem being that different data sets had slightly different countries included in their collections.  So I had to be careful to directly compare and look specifically into countries that were included on multiple data sets to have the most amount of comparisons available to me.

## Discoveries & Insights

### Emissions Over Time
| Year    | Graph <img width=1000/> |  Caption<img width=300/>  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| 2000 | <img src="https://hggorel.github.io/Project4/assets/images/Graph2.PNG" width="450" height="325"> | (Fig 1) The emissions recorded in 2000 for over 100 countries represented as a bubble graph with the largest bubbles and darkest color representing the most emissions |

Over this 18 year time period we can see the emergence of China as the highest emission producing country while the United States fell out of first place, which is good.  It is important to note that the exact scale changes with each year.  The highest emissions recorded in 2000 were much lower than the highest emissions recorded in 2018, but the switch of countries producing the most is still relevant and could indicate a slight greater effort for preserving the environment and decreasing the negative environmental impact on the part of that country.  This is where I started looking into the different other factors and ratings that my data sets contained including Climate Risk Index (CRI), Endangered Species stats and Amounts of Protected Lands for each country.

### A Closer Look at Highest Emission Countries

As we saw in the emissions graph, a few specific countries had the most emissions recorded in 2018.  Brazil, China, the EU, India, Japan, Russia and the United States all had the highest emissions on record.

(Fig 10 - This line graph explores the years 2017-2021 comparing the specified countries who reported the largest emissions in 2018 to see if any preventative actions would be taken given their high negative environmental impact)

## Conclusion

I found a few interesting conclusions from my explorations.  Contrary to my initial hope/belief, most of the countries reported with the highest emissions do not have high percentages of protected environmental areas.  They do not take those preventative steps, however, they do not all have the highest numbers of endangered species so that's not a direct correlation.  So factors other than emissions are contributing to the endangered species in different countries.  Additionally, the CRI rank of countries does not correlate to a lower emission amount to decrease the impact on climate change.  Which wasn't entirely surprising but does show that not all of the countries who have been heavily impacted and thus could stand to be impacted again if climate change worsens are making a large successful effort to decrease their environmental impact.
